Sunspot number is daily measured by observatories over the globe and is determined as
R = k(n + 10g), here n – number of observed sunspots, g – number of observed sunspot
groups, k – coefficient of a telescope. Solar radio flux at 10.7 cm is a measurement of radio
emission at a wavelength of 10.7 cm (2800 MHz) from all sources present on the solar disk
(sunspots, solar flares, solar proton events, white light faculae fields).
This Assignment is performed in the class by students as in teams of 2-3 and the team
will submit one document reporting about the performance till the given deadline. Within your
group, you may discuss all issues openly, and discuss and debate until you reach a consensus.
Here is the recommended procedure:
1. The code (Matlab/Python) should be commented.
It should include:
- Title of the Assignment, for example
%Relationship between solar radio flux F10.7 and sunspot number
- The names of a team, indication of Skoltech, and date, for example,
%Tatiana Podladchikova, Skoltech, 2019
Main procedures also should be commented, for example
%13-month running mean
...here comes the code
2. Download monthly mean sunspot number and solar radio flux F10.7cm measurements from
Canvas. Every team will have different files to work with. You can download either Matlab
or txt data (for Python):
